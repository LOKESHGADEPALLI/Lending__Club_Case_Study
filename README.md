## General Info
 * Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.
 * Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss)
 * Borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.
 * We need to to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using 
   EDA is the aim of this case study.
 * The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
